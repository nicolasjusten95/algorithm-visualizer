# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive and responsive algorithm visualization 
application. Currently, it supports visualization for three major sorting 
algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, interactive visualization 
tool for students, developers and anyone interested in understanding how 
sorting algorithms work.

## Features

- Visualizations of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms
- Step-by-Step animations for easy understanding
- Adjustable animation speed
- Adjustable array size

## Installation

In the project directory, follow the steps below:

1. Install required npm packages: ``npm install``
2. Start the application: ``npm start``
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Usage

- Start the visualization of the sorting algorithm you want by clicking 
the corresponding button.
- Generate a new random array by clicking the *Generate new array* button.
- Set the array size by navigating to the settings page and adjusting the 
*Array Size* slider.
- Set the animation speed by navigating to the settings page and adjusting 
the *Frames Per Animation* slider.
