# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a responsive algorithm visualization application.
Currently, it supports visualization for three major sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort.

The goal of this project is to provide a clear, interactive visualization 
tool for students, developers and anyone interested in understanding how 
sorting algorithms work.

## Features

- Visualizations of Bubble Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort algorithms
- Step-by-Step animations for easy understanding

## Installation

In the project directory, follow the steps below:

1. Install required npm packages: ``npm install``
2. Start the application: ``npm start``
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the 
browser

## Usage

Select the algorithm you want by clicking the corresponding button.
Generate a new random array by clicking the corresponding button.
